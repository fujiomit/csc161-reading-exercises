void foo(void){
     int x = 5;
     /* Point A */
     foo();
     printf("%d\n", x);
}

int main(void){
    foo();
    return 0;
}

The state of the computation:
Program Counter: 4

The Stack
=========
--- foo
  x [5]
--- main
   (empty)


The behavior of this program:
Execution of this program starts in main with the first statement of main
at line 9. On line 9, we execute a function call wchi causes execution of
the program to jump to foo. Now foo is the currently active frame. On line
2, we declare x = 5. After that, the program is at Point A outlined above.

What happens when this program executes?
It would infinitely execute the function called foo because foo takes foo
as its expression. Therefore, this program would not produce any value.
