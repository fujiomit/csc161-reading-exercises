//The first two loops initialize i as 0. However, while the first one does not cinclude i = 10 as its test condition, the second one does contain it.

//The third loop initalizes i as 1.

//The fourth and fifth loops initalize i as 10. While the fourth one does not contain i = 10 as its condition, the fifth one does include it.

//Question1; we should choose int n as initialization, and n < n+10
//Question2; we should choose int i = 0 as the initialization and 1 <= 10 as the test expression.
//Question3; we should choose int int i = 10 as the initizalization and i >= 0 as the expression.
